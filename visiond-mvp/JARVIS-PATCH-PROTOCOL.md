# JARVIS Patch Protocol — VisionD

When a VisionD ZIP is received with `J` or `เจ`:
1. Read VERSION, latest PATCH note, VISIOND-ROADMAP, VISIOND-MARKETING-PLAN and CUSTOMER-DATA-ANALYSIS.
2. Inspect available aggregate customer/business data before choosing work. Never invent production findings when data is unavailable.
3. Preserve security boundaries, especially Boss/Admin/User/Guest and Elon isolation.
4. Implement the selected patch with minimal regression surface.
5. Run relevant QA, security/regression and predeploy checks.
6. Update VERSION and patch notes.
7. Update roadmap statuses: Implemented / Deployed / Validated separately.
8. Update marketing plan from measured outcomes.
9. Update customer-data analysis with privacy-minimized findings and the evidence window used.
10. Report after delivery: what changed, what data says, what remains, and the recommended next patch.
11. If the current roadmap/marketing phase is complete, draft the next phase automatically as PROPOSED for Boss review.

Data rule: aggregate/minimum necessary. Never place customer PII, slip data, secrets, tokens or API keys in roadmap/marketing/handoff files.
