# Active patch: Deliver Showcase image fix through cache busting

- Status: READY
- Requested outcome: show a real product image in the Showcase table whenever TikTok supplied one through either Showcase or order product data.
- Root cause: the image fallback shipped in JavaScript, but the HTML retained the pre-patch asset URL `tiktok-analyzer.js?v=02081`, allowing browsers/CDN to keep serving stale code.
- Add: advance the analyzer JavaScript cache token to `02082` and update its regression contracts.
- Preserve: existing Showcase image priority, ordering, grades, metrics, pagination, delete actions, and one-card-one-channel isolation.
- Acceptance: the rendered page references `tiktok-analyzer.js?v=02082`; no `02081` analyzer contract remains; the image fallback regression still passes.
- Likely files: analyzer HTML and cache-token regression tests.
- Phase: implementation complete; delivery in progress.
- Verification: analyzer cache-busting PASS; Showcase order-image fallback PASS; sold-product name resolution PASS; F/ungraded PASS; manual C PASS; separated Marketplace/shop search PASS; Creator readiness PASS; diff check PASS.
- Delivery: pending commit and push to `origin main`.
