# Active patch: Animated homepage VX packages

- Status: PATCH_READY
- Verified: browser placement directly above original GIF, prices/links, desktop/mobile screenshots, pause/resume and reduced-motion. Diff check passed; sending scoped files to origin main.
- Outcome: animated VX feature/price banner immediately above existing homepage bundle GIF; preserve GIF, checkout and rights.
- Copy: multi-channel management, combined/per-channel commission dashboard, product search, A–F and Showcase. Prices 10/490, 20/980, 30/1290 THB for 30 days.
- Implementation: scoped HTML/CSS motion with pause and reduced-motion support, link to Vtools plans; desktop/mobile visual and placement/link tests, scoped commit/push and live check.

## Previous VX rights delivery

- Status: PATCH_DELIVERED
- Delivery: 9ad7d975 base and 9fbeb073 EasySlip addition pushed to origin main. Production /vtools returns 200 with v014580 and EasySlip text; /api/vtools returns all three exact 30-day prices/limits. No production payment made.
- EasySlip verification: mocked provider response exercised real upload handler and grant transaction; success, replay, amount/recipient mismatch, local duplicate, provider outage and missing key PASS. No real transfer or production slip submission.
- Added requirement: VX purchases must automatically verify slips through platform EasySlip, independently of the Vision3 manual-mode switch. Grant only after amount, recipient and duplicate checks pass; verification failures never grant access.
- Outcome: Vtools catalog and cart sell VX 30 days: 10 accounts / 490 THB; 20 / 980; 30 / 1290.
- Contract: server prices, activation on approval, idempotent grant, renewal queues after current rights, refund revokes, expiry and channel quota enforced by server. Preserve admin access and owner isolation.
- Phase: implementation, scoped commit/push and public production verification complete. No live purchase/payment approval for testing.
- Verified: real in-memory order creation/approval/replay, all prices, renewal/refund/expiry, quota/restore/downgrade, owner and admin isolation; browser desktop/mobile catalog and cart; partner commerce E2E; existing TikTok isolation, shortlist and grade tests; syntax and diff checks.
- Baseline limitation: whole-commerce suite fails mobile shell check on unchanged public/blog.html. Relevant commerce assertions pass. Details: visiond-mvp/docs/vtools-vx-access.md.

## Previous delivered patch

- Status: PATCH_DELIVERED
- Requested outcome: show a real product image in the Showcase table whenever TikTok supplied one through either Showcase or order product data.
- Root cause: the image fallback shipped in JavaScript, but the HTML retained the pre-patch asset URL `tiktok-analyzer.js?v=02081`, allowing browsers/CDN to keep serving stale code.
- Add: advance the analyzer JavaScript cache token to `02082` and update its regression contracts.
- Preserve: existing Showcase image priority, ordering, grades, metrics, pagination, delete actions, and one-card-one-channel isolation.
- Acceptance: the rendered page references `tiktok-analyzer.js?v=02082`; no `02081` analyzer contract remains; the image fallback regression still passes.
- Likely files: analyzer HTML and cache-token regression tests.
- Phase: implementation complete; delivery in progress.
- Verification: analyzer cache-busting PASS; Showcase order-image fallback PASS; sold-product name resolution PASS; F/ungraded PASS; manual C PASS; separated Marketplace/shop search PASS; Creator readiness PASS; diff check PASS.
- Delivery: cache-busting correction committed as `35d9a4ca` and pushed to `origin main`.
